Demo application for storing books and authors

The application does the following:

1. Reads a structured XML file and prints it out
2. Performs CRUD operations on Books and Authors
3. Searches for books or authors

The following technologies were used:
1. SpringBoot
2. Hibernate
3. H2 database
4. Maven
5. Postman for testing all functionality

In order to run the application, run "mvn package" and then run the file on the console as follows:
java -jar library-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.

I used Postman to test the functionality of the application.
